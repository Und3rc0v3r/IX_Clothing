# Welcome to IX_Clothing

Alright, I'm gonna get you up to ***Speed*** on my project and I'm gonna keep it short & sweet.
first off...

# Production Version
I've deployed my master branch onto Heroku, [https://ixclothing.herokuapp.com/](https://ixclothing.herokuapp.com/)
Local build is of my dev branch witch is pretty much Le same.
to get local working, do NPM  INSTALL 
then NPM START
then navigate to http://localhost:8090

Next to explain is...

## What the site actually is
Right so the sight is a concept page for a clothing brand, so there's no sales funktion, but that doesn't mean there's no funk. 
Quick site breakdown
Static page that is populated by two entities,
|Entities|What you can do  |
|--|--|
| Clothing | Change clothing listing by type |
|Gallery| View images of people wearing said clothes (tagged) and you can add your own if you sign up

Steven said client side documentation isn't needed so that's done


## Server-side Documentation
AKA Api documentation.
"-   Compare with e.g.  [twitter API docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index)" was pretty vague since they don't use markdown. so I haven't used markdown either. 

Here's my api docs [IX_Clothing API Documentation](https://ixclothing.herokuapp.com/doc/)

local version of API docs [Relative path](client/doc/index.html)  if link broken (jmqb44 -> client -> doc -> index.html)


## Extension Criteria

Cloud deployment : [https://ixclothing.herokuapp.com/](https://ixclothing.herokuapp.com/)
Remote web service integration: Google Auth when signing in and uploading images
